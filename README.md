This repo contains the necessary steps for setting up the environment for a calendar porting project. 

  * [Installing the Polyglot-Jif-Fabric Stack](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Polyglot-Jif-Fabric-Stack.md): <br />
Documenting the necessary steps that I needed to follow to get Fabric installed. 

  * [Sif on MacOSX](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Sif-On-MacOSX.md): <br />
Outlining issues with the the Sif 1.0.3 distribution's read me file which does not account for MacOSX users.

  * [Calendar Application Overview](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Calendar-App.md): <br />
We review the capabilities of the calendar in the Sif-Jif distribution to ensure that the necessary components are transferred when ported to Fabric. Some features may not be possible to port directly, and the limitations should be explored as well as possible work arounds.
