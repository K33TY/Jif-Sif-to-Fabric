# From Jif-Sif to Fabric
This repo contains the necessary steps for setting up the environment for a calendar porting project.

  * [Polyglot-Jif-Fabric Stack](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Polyglot-Jif-Fabric-Stack.md): <br />
The application stack for running Fabric. 

  * [Installing the Polyglot-Jif-Fabric Stack on MacOSX](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/README_MacOS_Install.md): <br />
Documenting the necessary steps that I needed to follow to get Fabric installed. 

  * [Sif on MacOSX](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Sif-On-MacOSX.md): <br />
Outlining issues with the the Sif 1.0.3 distribution's read me file which does not account for MacOSX users.

  * [Calendar Application Overview](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Calendar-App.md): <br />
We review the capabilities of the calendar in the Sif-Jif distribution to ensure that the necessary components are transferred when ported to Fabric. Some features may not be possible to port directly, and the limitations should be explored as well as possible work arounds. 

 * [Log](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Log.md): <br />
 I decided to start tracking my research on October 9th so that I could keep track of links, relevant info I encountered, and ideas.
