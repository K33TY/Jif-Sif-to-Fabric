# Distributed Information Flow Calendar Web App Created in Fabric

## Goals
These are the main goals that I hope to accomplish this semester:

  + [Port all functionality from the Jif/Sif Calendar App to a Fabric implementation](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Calendar-App.md#capabilities-and-parameters)
  + Ensure capabilities listed in link above are correctly implemented in new application.
  + Keep documentation of any hacks needed for installation
  + [Log progress](https://github.com/K33TY/Jif-Sif-to-Fabric/blob/master/Docs/Log.md)
  

## Secondary Goals
If time permits, these are additional goals that I hope to accomplish:

  + Implement improvements to the calendar app's UI and usability.
  + Extend from current hardcoding of users to perhaps allow adding users
  + Figure out how to automate the build process for this example.
  + Figure out how use shared .jar libraries in Jetty.
