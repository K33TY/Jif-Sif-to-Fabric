# Documentation for Fabric Classes

Not all classes documented, since only documenting as needed...

Also, applying Doxygen to save some time, but noting that Doxygen is not complete and is 
missing many functions and even some whole classes.

(At this point I think the majority of code that I will be sourcing from the project should be in the system/fabric 
directory)
